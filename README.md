# Real-Time-Traffic-Prediction-Model-
This project utilizes historical traffic data to train a machine learning model, such as a neural network/time series model, to predict traffic congestion levels in various parts of London.

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict real-time traffic conditions in London using historical traffic data provided by Transport for London. The goal is to enhance urban mobility by providing accurate traffic predictions and visualizing them through an interactive dashboard.

### Features
- Real-time traffic prediction using machine learning models.
-  Integration and analysis of traffic data from Transport for London.
- Interactive dashboard for visualizing traffic conditions and predictions.

### Data Sources
Traffic Data: Obtained from Transport for London.

### Architecture
A high-level architecture of the project, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and dashboard visualization.
